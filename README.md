## Git vs. GitHub
git status: inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add: adds to the staging area
git commit: adds to your repository
git log: lets you view commits stored in the repository chronologically
git diff: checks the differences between the working directory and the staging area

## Initial Setup
**git config** Used to shape/order/put togeter or order something.

   - Example:git config --global user.email _"jondoe@hstat.org"_
2.git config --global user.name "Your Name" then press the enter key
3.eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
4. Do ls -al (Lists all files) ~/.ssh you should now see a file named id_rsa.pub
5. cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Gives a LONG string of text) then copy all of the result to your clipboard
6. Go to https://github.com/settings/keys > New SSH Key
 - Title the Key: ide50
 - Key: paste your ssh key (Long line of text)
 Press the green Add SSH key button
